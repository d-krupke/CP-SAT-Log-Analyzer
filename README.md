# CP-SAT-Log-Analyzer

Dive into the world of constraint programming with ease using our CP-SAT Log
Analyzer. This tool transforms the dense and detailed logs of CP-SAT into clear,
readable formats, complemented by intuitive visualizations of key metrics.
Whether you're tuning your model or exploring data, our analyzer simplifies and
enlightens your journey with CP-SAT. Let us make complex logs simple and
actionable!

## Easy Upload

Various ways to quickly upload your log files, and multiple examples to get you
started. If you have you log file uploaded somewhere, you can also create a link
to it that you can share with others. There are some simple security measures in
place to prevent abuse. Please let me know if they are too restrictive.

## Overview

The overview page gives you a quick overview of the most important metrics of
your log file.

## Documentation

The logs are not only parsed and displayed, but also explained. Hovering over
the question mark next to a metric will give you a short explanation of what it
means. The individual parts of the log are annotated with a basic explanation.

## Plotting

Some important time series are plotted to give you a better understanding of
what is going on in your log file. It is interactive, and you can zoom in and
out. The hover-text gives you context on what you are looking at.

## Tabular Data

The log contains a lot of tabular data. We parse them into nice interactive
tables.

## Development

You can run this project locally by cloning it and running the following
commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Project Structure

This project has a relatively simple structure, consisting of two main parts:

1. The streamlit app with entry point `app.py` and implementation in `./_app`.
2. The parser and log documentation in `cpsat_log_parser`.

If you want to improve the parsing or documentation of a block of the log, you
can do so by just editing the corresponding file in `cpsat_log_parser/blocks`.
Every block has its own file with a name corresponding to the block name.

If you want to add a new block, you can do so by creating a new file in
`cpsat_log_parser/blocks`. The file should contain a class with the same name as
the block. This class should inherit from `LogBlock` and implement a static
`matches`-method that returns `True` if the passed part of the log matches the
block. The `get_title` and `get_help` methods should return a title and help
text for the block. For tables, there already is a `TableBlock` which is able to
return the table as a pandas DataFrame and the front-end will know to display it
as a table. If your block is more complex and wants to display plots or other
things, you will have to add a special section to the front-end. For the block
to be found, you will also have to add it to the `ALL_BLOCKS` in
`cpsat_log_parser/blocks/__init__.py`. The parser will then automatically try to
use it. Note that the order of the list is important, as the first block that
matches will be used. The `LogBlock` should always be the last as it matches
everything.

### Roadmap

Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- [ ] Implement the ability to upload multiple log files and compare them.
- [ ] Extend the documentation of the blocks. Currently, I only wrote some
      documentation for the most important blocks, sometimes by just copying
      from the CP-SAT Primer and letting ChatGPT quickly make it more readable.
- [ ] A more extensive list of examples. I have some nice examples, where you
      can actually see issues in different parts of the log, highlighting their
      importance.

## Changes

- 2024-10-31: Added a log history to quickly switch back to previous logs.
- 2024-10-31: Fixed parsing when the model was solved in presolve.
- 2024-09-05: Improved the parsing of the parameters.
- 2024-09-05: No longer warn if status is `OPTIMAL`, but there is a gap, as
  CP-SAT considers everything as optimal if you specified a tolerance. This is
  different to other solvers. Don't want to confuse users.
