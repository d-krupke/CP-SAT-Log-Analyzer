        This block gives an overview of the model before presolve.
        It contains the number of variables and constraints, as well as coefficients and domains.

        `- 200 in [0,199]` will indicate that there are 200 variables with domain `[0,199]`, i.e., values between 0 and 199.

        `#kLinearN: 3'000 (#terms: 980'948)` indicates that there are 3000 linear constraints with 980'948 coefficients.`

        It is useful to compare this to the model after presolve and also if this matches your expectations.
        The presolve-phase may reformulate your model extensively to make it more efficient.

        Since most optimization models are created dynamically in code, reviewing this
        section can help identify bugs or inefficiencies. Take the time to verify that
        the numbers match your expectations and ensure you do not have too many or too
        few variables or constraints of a certain type. This step is crucial as it also
        provides insight into the number of auxiliary variables in your model, helping
        you better understand its structure and complexity.
