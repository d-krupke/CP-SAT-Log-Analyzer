    To begin analyzing with CP-SAT Log Analyzer, please upload your log file. If you haven't already, you can generate a log file by enabling the log output. Simply set the `log_search_progress` parameter to `True` in your CP-SAT solver configuration. Once this is done, you'll have a detailed log ready for upload and analysis.

    The log usually starts as follows:
    ```
    Starting CP-SAT solver v9.7.2996
    Parameters: log_search_progress: true
    Setting number of workers to 24

    ...
    ```

    Only complete and properly formatted logs are supported for now.
